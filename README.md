The task assigned was to develop a website similar to a given reference website using only HTML, without using CSS, JavaScript, or any other technologies. The main objective was to understand the structure, content flow, and navigation of the reference website and recreate it using pure HTML elements.

Based on the reference website, a multi-page website was designed and developed. The website consists of several pages including Home, About Us, Programs and Projects, Resources, Contact Us, and a Login page. Each page is interlinked using HTML anchor tags to ensure smooth navigation across the website.

The Home page provides an overview of the organization, its purpose, and key focus areas. The About Us page explains the vision, mission, values, and background of the organization. The Programs and Projects page highlights various initiatives such as health, education, environmental conservation, and livelihood development. The Resources page contains information about reports, training materials, policy documents, and research publications. The Contact Us page provides communication details and includes a basic contact form created using HTML forms. A static Login page was also created to demonstrate page navigation.

Throughout the development process, only standard HTML tags such as <table>, <a>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <form>, and <img> were used. The project successfully meets the requirement of creating a structured and functional website using HTML only, while maintaining clarity, simplicity, and professional presentation.
